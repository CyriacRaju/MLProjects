# MLProjects
This repository contains the Machine Learning Projects that I have done.

1. MLSocialAnxiety: \
    In this project, I analyse the 'Social Anxiety Dataset' dataset from Kaggle and then build different machine learning models to classify the individuals with high and low anxieties. This dataset contains information like demographics, lifestyle, health indicators, mental health history, and life events, about individuals with varying levels of social anxiety.
